            I began my tech journey at 16, building systems for local businesses in Ankara. By 20, from the 16th floor
            of an ISP, I was architecting solutions that would shape my career. Today, I design digital solutions that
            power international businesses. My experience spans from <span class="highlight">fighting hyperinflation
                with smart pricing systems</span>
            to <span class="highlight">building real-time analytics that doubled company revenues</span>. I don't just
            write code â€“ I craft digital
            ecosystems that scale and evolve.

                <strong>Freelance Developer</strong> | Self-employed | Early Career (2012 - 2018)
            </p>
            <p>
                Started my coding journey at 16, partnering with a fellow teenage developer to build solutions for our
                local community. We were young, ambitious, and eager to prove ourselves. Between high school classes, we
                crafted ordering systems for neighborhood cafes, built inventory management tools for small shops, and
                designed websites for local businesses. These early projects, though simple by today's standards, taught
                me the
                fundamentals of solving real-world problems with code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back, we were learning as we went, figuring things out through trial and error. But the local
                business community was incredibly supportive, giving us chances to prove ourselves. The income from
                these projects (around $2500 in 2018) enabled us to upgrade from basic laptops to proper development
                machines,
                fueling our passion further. What started as teenage curiosity evolved into a clear career path, shaped
                by
                the trust of our first 15+ clients and over 20 successful projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you, Ankara, for believing in two young developers with big dreams.

        <h2>Professional Values</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <strong>Why does this section exist?</strong> Technical skills and experience are only part of the story.
            These values guide how I approach problems,
            work with teams, and craft solutions. They reflect lessons learned from both successes and failures
            throughout my journey.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplicity First:</strong> I believe the best solutions are often the simplest ones. Complex
                systems should be built from simple, well-understood components.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Impact:</strong> I focus on delivering real business value rather than chasing
                technical perfection. The best code is the one that solves actual problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Elimination:</strong> Sometimes the best solution is no code at all. I've saved projects
                months of development by identifying existing solutions or simplifying requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Evolution:</strong> Systems should be planned to evolve. I build for change, not for
                permanence.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Just as the Ankara community supported my early career, I believe in
                giving back through mentorship and community contribution.</li>
